\description{
From ACLED's homepage: \emph{The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project
(ACLED) is a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping
project. ACLED collects information on the dates, actors, locations,
fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events
around the world. The ACLED team conducts analysis to describe, explore, and
test conflict scenarios, and makes both data and analysis open for free use
by the public.}
}
\details{
In order to access data from the ACLED API, you first must register
an account. Make sure you register with your institutional domain
(e.g., organization, university, or company) email address rather than
your personal email address, in order to be able to use the API,
as explained \href{https://acleddata.com/myacled-faqs}{here}.
Note that the ACLED API provides a \emph{living database}
with single events being altered or removed altogether over time.
